# Python Django React NextJs JWT


## Description

This repository contains a sample project that demonstrates how to use Django as the backend for a Next.js app, with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. The project includes a Django server that serves a REST API and a Next.js frontend that consumes the API. The frontend uses JWT for authentication and authorization, with the Django server serving as the JWT issuer and verifier. This project can be used as a starting point for building full-stack web applications with Django and Next.js.
